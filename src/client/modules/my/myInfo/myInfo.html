                    I'm a Philadelphia based web developer originally from New
                    York City, specializing in clean modern looks and innovative
                    visions. When I'm not coding I'm usually traveling the
                    world... and still coding.

                    I love developing web pages but also have an immense passion
                    for teaching others how to code. I've tutored students
                    ranging in ages 13 - 60 years old.
